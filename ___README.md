Are the docs for antora and asciidoctor and asciidoctor.js out of date? They need to mention the change in extension name from @antora/tabs-extension to @asciidoc/tabs

I have clones, some of which are forked.

Antora Gitlab fork: Z:\code\amdphreak\antora

. Please fix them, commit, push, fork to the-dev-center org if needed (please check if remotes need to be updated first), and then find issues mentioning this problem. If none can be found, create a new issue, create a PR, and link the issue in PR description.
